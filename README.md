# Multiverse --- pytorch version

Implementation of the losses from [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17778).

## TODO

- [x] Cross entropy in the PERM loss form
- [x] Family-wise loss in the class-score form
- [ ] Family-wise loss in the PERM loss form

## Setup/Installation

### Method 1: download then install

Navigate to the root directory of this repository, then run the following in shell.

```
pip install .
```

### Method 2: pip install from github

```
pip install git+https://github.com/YutongWangUMich/multiverse_pytorch.git
```
